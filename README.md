- 👋 Hi, I’m @codeaau
- 👀 I'm self-learning programming late-2021 with initial intentions of being a Software Engineer — Backend/DevOps focus, and possibly more.
- 🌱 So far, I've learned a few programming langauges to get a feel for things, initially intending on simply being a DB Admin, but it has expanded to Software Engineer [BackEnd | DevOps]. My list:
      (fundamentals) Python, JavaScript (CSS, HTML, Node, TypeScript), (basic) SQL [MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL], (fundamentals) PHP, (beginner) PowerShell.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with as many people/things as possible, so I may further expand my skill-set, experience, and intentions.
- 📫 How to reach me: here on github or my email: azim@ukani.com.
