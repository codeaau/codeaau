- 👋 Hi, I’m @codeaau
- 👀 I’m a Python Fresher who's interested in learning and contributing whenever convenient.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MySQL, with intentions of learning as many things as possible to further improve my ability to execute my projects/assignments - which currently are none.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mutual interests, and provide support wherever needed - within reason.
- 📫 How to reach me: here on github and my email: azim@ukani.com.
