- 👋 Hi, I’m @codeaau
- 👀 I'm self-learning programming for 2+ years with initial intentions of being a Full-stack Web Dev, and possibly more.
- 🌱 So far, I've learned a few programming langauges to get a feel for things, initially intending on simply being a DB Admin, but it has expanded to WebDev and possible Software Engineer. My list:
      (fundamentals) Python, JavaScript (CSS, HTML, Node.js), (basic) MySQL, (fundamentals) PHP, (beginner) PowerShell.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on as many people/things, so I may further expand my skillset, experience, and intentions.
- 📫 How to reach me: here on github or my email: azim@ukani.com.
