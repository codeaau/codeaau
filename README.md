- 👋 Hi, I’m @codeaau
- 👀 I'm self-learning programming for 2+ years with initial intentions of being a Full-stack Web Dev, and possibly more.
- 🌱 I’ve passively learned 'edX Harvard's Intro to CS50' online, as well as the fundamentals on: Python, JavaScript (CSS, HTML, Node.js), MySQL, PHP, PowerShell (... and possibly more).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on as many people/things I can to further expand my skillset, experience, and intentions.
- 📫 How to reach me: here on github and my email: azim@ukani.com.
